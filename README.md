# bios-bt05
Automated Update BIOS of Gene BT-05 with a Teensy

- sending the respective keystrokes via Teensy to BT-05 on power-on
- Uses teensyduino, tested with Teensy-LC and Teensy 3.0 with Arduino 1.0.6
- A great way to "debug" these kind of keyboard-simulators is to use the tool: key-mon (under Linux)
